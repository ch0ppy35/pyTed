## _Aut viam inveniam aut faciam_

Here's a README for an obscure project.   

### What is it?
This is a Flask app that's being written as a front-end for 
[TED - The Energy Detective](https://www.theenergydetective.com/). 

A neat gadget, check it out.

### Why?
We want/need a dashboard for mobile, and we didn't want to write an Android app _and_ a iOS app. 

### What it needs to run
Python3, check requirements.  You'll need a Postgres endpoint too.
